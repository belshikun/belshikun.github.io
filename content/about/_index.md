I am a computational biophysicist and pianist with interests in mathematics, music theory, history, and literature. This website is a place to post the logs of my Dungeons and Dragons campaigns, essays, random musings, and so on. The name of the site is an anagram of my old Twitter handle, `@CurlOfGradient`. I am no longer on Twitter, but perhaps at some point I will upload the archive of my old tweets.
