I'm not happy with the way I use the internet. I continually refresh the same websites, hoping something new has appeared since last time---usually there's nothing. Occasionally I'll find something interesting, but it's never worth the time I've wasted. The slot machine analogy, though clich√©d, is still relevant. I feel a little spark of excitement and anticipation every time I check, and that strengthens the compulsion, even though I am disappointed most of the time.

This is a problem, because it's not like I'm enjoying myself while doing it. I'm not getting distracted and only realizing what I've done hours later. I'm constantly, miserably hyper-aware that I'm wasting time---that the majority of what I'm reading isn't important, useful, or even interesting to me. I'd rather read a book. Instead I keep going, afraid I'll miss something that would make the time spent all worthwhile. But nothing could possibly be good enough to outweigh such a massive cost.

For some sites---like blogs---there is a simple solution. Instead of checking compulsively to see if they updated, I simply follow them via RSS. This reduces the number of sites I need to check to just one. If nothing has updated, there's no possibility of having my attention sucked away, because I will be met with an empty screen. Other sites offer newsletters. When new articles come out, I will be sent an email. If I don't get the email, I don't need to bother checking the site.

It's not blogs I compulsively waste my time checking, though. Blogs are nice. Blogs only update once every few days. Blogs are of reliable quality because they're the work of a single person. No, the real culprits are social media sites and content aggregators like Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, et cetera. These sites are continuous firehoses of content, so an RSS feed is pointless. Plus, the average quality is incredibly low because literally anyone can make an account. I can't remember the last time I found something legitimately good on Reddit.

My life would improve immeasurably if I never visited these sites again. But for some reason, I find this difficult to do. I've tried using browser add-ons to block my access to certain sites, or to limit the amount of time I spend on them per day, but these are trivial to circumvent and I always do. I don't even think such measures are the correct solution to the problem; what I need is something outside the internet to occupy my time with.

But it's a vicious cycle, because I'm too busy with the internet to get deeper into my hobbies! Plus, I don't want to avoid using these sites entirely. Reddit is occasionally the only place one can find answers to certain questions. YouTube is how I became such a good cook. I have friends on Twitter. How do I reduce the amount of time I spend on these sites without just quitting them cold turkey forever? What does a healthy relationship with the internet look like?

A few more unorganized thoughts about the internet.

If you've been on a content aggregator for long enough, you begin to notice that a lot of the best content comes from the same few sites. For example, the majority of the time I find something legitimately interesting on Hacker News, it's from Quanta Magazine, Nautilus, or some other magazine in that general space. Wouldn't it be better to follow those sites directly (via RSS or newsletters, of course) and skip the Hacker News step entirely? Of course it would. The fear, though, is that by doing that I'd be missing out on *new* sites to follow.

I think the key to avoiding this whole mess I'm in is to trust that the people around me will link me to anything interesting they find, or that I can just ask if anyone knows an interesting source on a particular topic.

You also notice that the comments are basically never worth reading. Large subreddits, for example, routinely have chains of comments dozens of levels deep, each making a slightly different variation on the same joke in a desperate attempt to accumulate karma. There are a thousand low-effort joke/meme comments for every normal comment, and a thousand normal comments for every comment that is actually worth reading. Who has the time to search through all that? &#x2766;
