For a while now, I've been planning to read through the major works of western literature and philosophy. I've been stymied by the issues I brought up in [On Taking Notes]({{< ref "on-taking-notes" >}}), but also by my dislike of e-readers. However, I realized yesterday that I live within walking distance of one of the largest public libraries in the country, and I can rent a physical copy any book I want, for free. I haven't been to a library since I was eight, so the idea of getting a library card never crossed my mind. (Even though I've been meaning to go to this library for like a year. Why did I want to go? To see the murals.)

My plan is to start with the Ancient Greeks, using Albin Lesky's *A History of Greek Literature* (which I already own) as my guide. I will try to avoid taking notes---or at least avoid feeling like I *have to* take notes---save for a short review when I finish each book. Renting books with a deadline also means I will have a little bit more motivation to finish the book before I have to return it.

On a related note, I would also like to start a listening spree through the history of western music, using Richard Crocker's *A History of Musical Style* as my resource---hopefully I can easily find recordings of old Gregorian chants on YouTube... &#x2766;
