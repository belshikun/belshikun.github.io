I used to read a lot. When I was little, I routinely stayed up late with a book and a flashlight and hid under the covers until my parents caught me. In college I once estimated that I was reading close to one million words of prose every month. But somehow, over time, I pretty much stopped reading.

I had internalized the idea that I needed to take notes on everything I read. My thoughts went like this: If I don't take notes, then I'll have nothing to show for all the time I spent reading. And what if, in the future, I want to write something that references this book? I don't want to have to read it *again*, do I? I'd better summarize the entire book right now!

Taking notes with this mindset was frustrating and emotionally draining. I couldn't know beforehand what information future-me would need, so I felt compelled to summarize everything, just in case. This slowed my reading to a crawl. So, to avoid the guilt of reading without taking notes, I simply avoided reading altogether.

At first I thought this was the fault of my note-taking system. I had read Mortimer Adlerâ€™s *How to Read a Book*, but maybe I needed something more structured and sophisticated? I looked into Luhmann's Zettelkasten system (via S&ouml;nke Ahren's *How to Take Smart Notes*), I looked into apps like Roam Research and Obsidian, but it was all a waste of time.

Those guides covered how to add new notes to the system, and how to use notes that were already in the system, but they never addressed what I considered the most important, pivotal question: How do you decide which information to add in the first place? No one ever seemed to mention this!

Eventually, I discovered the problem. I had always assumed that the point of note-taking was to stockpile information for future use. Any time I read anything, I was supposed to add it to the stockpile, in case it later turned out to be useful for some project. This is just digital hoarding. The problem was that I had no goal in mind for my notes. Without some specific project to limit my scope and direct my attention, there was no way to tell what was relevant---every sentence was fair game. This is why I found taking notes to be such a suffocating burden.

Luhmann's Zettelkasten was not filled with notes on everything he ever read. It was specifically for his work in sociology, and when he put new notes into the system he already knew how they related to the projects he was working on and how they may someday be used. He wasn't just stuffing any old fact into the system.

Therefore, unless I am reading something for a specific project that I have in mind, there's no reason to take notes. And there's *definitely* no reason to take notes if I'm reading for pleasure. A review, perhaps, but not notes. I believe this is the correct stance, but I still feel in my gut like I'm rationalizing---like I'm trying to weasel out of the hard work of honest reading. It will take time for me to correct my gut feelings, but at least I have discovered where those gut feelings come from and why they're maladaptive.
