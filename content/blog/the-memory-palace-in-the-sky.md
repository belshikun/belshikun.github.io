I realized several years ago that the night sky serves as its own memory palace, making the names and locations of stars exceptionally easy to memorize. I started methodically with the winter triangle and got through all the major stars in Orion, Taurus, Auriga, Gemini, Canis Minor, and Canis Major before I stopped. Each night, I would add two or three new stars to my mental list, and a few times each day I would mentally go over all the stars I had already learned. All it required was a star chart---no flashcards, no programs, no writing anything down.

Part of what made memorizing the stars so easy is their random layout and varying brightness. If the stars were arranged in a regular grid and all looked the same, memorizing them would be much harder. The fact that we chunk the stars into constellations also helps. This suggests that if you want to memorize something with less structure, imposing your own, additional structure on it would be a great strategy. The more elaborate, the better. For example, memorizing the Roman emperors is easier than it otherwise would be because we split them up into dynasties, call five of them "The Five Good Emperors", group four of them into the Year of the Four Emperors, and so on. &#x2766;
