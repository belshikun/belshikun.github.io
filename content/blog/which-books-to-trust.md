Should one read books for their literary value if they misrepresent the facts? I was debating whether to read *The Story of Civilization* by Will and Ariel Durant, an eleven-volume series covering the history of (mostly European) civilization. However, it is generally considered by historians to be deeply flawed---the Durants take the ancient sources at face value, misrepresent facts, and so on---and I’d probably come out the other side believing things that aren't true.

This reminds me more generally of the problem with reading books not written by domain experts, or trusting reviews written by general readers. Stephen Jay Gould isn't taken seriously by biologists, but general readers love him because they don’t know any better. (I was mildly disappointed to see that Oliver Sacks praises Gould in a footnote in *Awakenings*.) I guess the only way to avoid this is to get really good at navigating scientific journals and only trusting recommendations by scientists in the relevant field? &#x2766;
