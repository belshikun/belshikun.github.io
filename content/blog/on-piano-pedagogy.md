During my time researching piano pedagogy, I've encountered practical advice that I've never seen outside of music but which I'm sure would apply to other fields. Here are the top three that stood out to me over the years.

First: *Practice doesn't make perfect, practice makes permanent.* If you keep making a mistake when playing a certain section of music, do not play that section over and over again, making the same mistake each time, hoping that it will eventually fix itself. It won't. You're just practicing the mistake, and you'll just get very good at making it. It's better to play slowly enough that you can play it without mistakes, and only gradually increase the tempo. Avoid mindless repetition.

Second: *Don't practice until you get it right, practice until you can't get it wrong.* If you are practicing something and get it right on the hundredth try, you can't just stop for the day. So far you have played it wrong ninety-nine times and right once. Which version do you think your muscle memory will remember tomorrow? Practice until you've played it right at least as many times as youâ€™ve played it wrong.

Third: *Running is not just walking very fast.* A common technique for increasing speed is to start playing a section very slowly, incrementally increasing the tempo each time you become comfortable at the current tempo. However, this is not always guaranteed to work. There may come a point where you hit a wall; you can no longer increase the speed, no matter how hard you try. This is because the hand motions you need to play the piece fast are not the same hand motions that come naturally when playing the piece slowly. It's like trying to run by speed-walking faster and faster. The solution is to play it fast, ignoring accuracy, and figure out the required hand motions, then play those hand motions, slowed down, rather than the natural hand motions you had been playing before. &#x2766;
