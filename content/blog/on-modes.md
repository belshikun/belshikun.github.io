Every explanation of the diatonic modes that I was exposed to in childhood used the same ordering: Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian. The reason is simple: If you play a scale from C to C using only the white keys, you have the Ionian mode; if you play from D to D, you have a Dorian mode; and so on. This was very simple, easy for me to remember, and utterly handicapped my ability to think about modes.

If I wanted to play an F-sharp Mixolydian scale, my thought process went like this: *Okay, F-sharp Mixolydian. Mixolydian is when you start on the fifth degree of the regular major scale... what scale is F-sharp the fifth of? Uhh... B? Yeah, B major. Okay, so I need to play the notes in the B major scale, but starting on the F-sharp, and that’s Mixolydian.*

This was a painfully slow multi-step process. I don’t know how many other people have the same problem that I did, but given how common this explanation is and how many years it took to find a better way of thinking about modes, there are probably a few. If you were like me, I hope this helps you.

The better way of thinking about modes is to forget all that stuff about starting on different degrees of a major scale and just remember the following rules:

- Lydian is major but with a raised fourth.
- Ionian is major.
- Mixolydian is major but with a flat seventh.
- Dorian is minor but with a raised sixth.
- Aeolian is minor.
- Phrygian is minor but with a flat second.
- Locrian is minor but with a flat second *and* a flat fifth.

That's it. If I want to play an F-sharp Mixolydian scale, I just think: *Ok, that’s an F-sharp major scale with a flat seventh.* It’s much faster.

Incidentally, the order in which I wrote this new list---Lydian, Ionian, Mixolydian, Dorian, Aeolian, Phrygian, Locrian---is a much better ordering of the modes (in my opinion). First of all, the modes are ordered by their character. Lydian, Ionian, and Mixolydian are the three major modes, with Lydian being happier than Ionian (almost manic, really), and Mixolydian being more subdued. Dorian, Aeolian, and Phrygian are the three minor modes, with Dorian being more mysterious and aloof than Aeolian and Phrygian being much darker. Then you have Locrian, the black sheep as always.

This ordering of the modes is also organized by the circle of fifths. Try playing all the modes starting on C in the original order---C Ionian, C Dorian, C Phrygian, etc. There isn't really any rhyme or reason to it. Now try playing all the modes starting on C in the better order---C Lydian, C Ionian, C Mixolydian, etc. Each mode is just one note off from the previous, always by flattening one note of the previous mode. At the end, after you play C Locrian, you can flatten the C and start the cycle over again with B Lydian. Try it!

One last interesting fact about the modes. The three major modes---Lydian, Ionian, and Mixolydian---differ from each other only in the fourth and seventh scale degrees. The major pentatonic scale contains all the notes of the major scale *except* the fourth and seventh; therefore, the major pentatonic scale is a subset of all three major modes. The three minor modes---Dorian, Aeolian, and Phrygian---differ from each other in the second and sixth degrees, which the minor pentatonic scale does not contain, so the minor pentatonic is a subset of all three minor modes. &#x2766;
