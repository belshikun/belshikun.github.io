## Saturday, December 8, 652 AU (continued)

In the main atrium of the temple, the part is approached by a new face. He introduces himself as **Thaldohr Broadbuster**, a dwarven swordsmith-turned-cook who has been wandering the land helping people protect themselves after the inn he used to cook at was attacked by bandits. He couldn't help overhearing the party talking about their adventures, and would like to join them.

"We were just talking about the hydra in Kyasha's Pass," says Aurelia.

"A hydra? I've always wanted to slay a hydra," says Thaldohr.

"That's perfect!" says Valya.

"You seem much more capable than the captain..." says Aurelia.

"*Everyone* is more capable than the captain," says Valya. "He's just a bureaucrat---he barely knows how to hold a sword."

"Regardless," says Aurelia, "killing the hydra is something we need to do at some point. We have a few other tasks---we've heard about the undead in Silverdale, and we were planning to head that way soon. But it is our duty to eventually defeat the hydra. It would do much good for the entire kingdom."

"So that's Aurelia... she's sort of the heart of our party," says Valya. "And..." she looks around, suddenly confused. "Where are Qhask and Abundance?" The two are nowhere to be seen.

"Well, we can look for them later," says Aurelia. "I'm going to talk to Cedric about the... item we acquired from the shipment. Then we have to go see Jonas and Dusk---we promised we would give them half the profits from the delivery."

"What are we going to do with it, though?" asks Valya.

"I'm not sure... but maybe Cedric will have an idea."

---

They ask the priestess Arabella if Cedric is free. She excuses herself to check, and then returns a minute later and tells them that Cedric can see them now. Arabella leads them down the halls to Cedric's office, where they find him reading some parchments.

"You asked to see me?" says Cedric.

"Yes, this is a bit of a sensitive matter," says Aurelia. Cedric nods, and Arabella leaves the room---Aurelia closes the door behind her. "We seem to have come across a very concerning artifact.

An artifact?

That seems to be contianin gthe soul of a devilk.

He takes his glasses off and puts them down on the table.

Are you certain?

YUes. We spoke with her, and she seemed very keen on being released. We of course did not release her.

Cedric is at a loss for words for a moment. A devil. Surely you mean an imp, or a quasit, or...

I believe she seems to be quite powerful and quite old. Her name is Valspira.

That doesn't ring a bell..

She seems to have last been loose in the world for several hundred years.

VALYA: more than 650---she seemed to know Raymond Fentris, but didn't know he became king.

How did oyu come across this orb?

There was a job posting for transporting something to the Red Eagle shipping company. One of our compatriots was concerned because there were attacks on the party originally hired to transport it, and wanted us to check on it. We opened it, and discovered the devil. We don't know why it was being shipped.

We should bring this up with the guard, discreetly of course, we need to investigate the Red Eagle.

We've gotten some information about them, according to some local merchants, it may or may not be a shell company for the Daykin family. And I know we shouldn't be inovled in that kind of ploitics but it is very concerning, especially if it means whoever was sending it could be trying to do harm to the royal family.

And there were rumors of imps flying out of the towers when the estate was burning

Valya: I wanted to ask about that, did you ever suspect anything about the Dakyins?

No, but if they're dealing in fiendish pacts, that's certainly a cause for alarm. He sighs. May I see this orb?

Valya: I guess... (Gets out the box, opens it)

Aurelia warns She will try to bargain with you.

Cedric cautiously opens the box

Valspira: Ah, finally, my rescuer!

Cedric closes the box

Rule number one of dealing with fiends; never listen to them for longer than you have to. I will consult the archives, perhaps we have mention of this valspira somewhere... it takes powerful magic to do this, surely someone msut have recorded its exidstence

Valya: what swhould we do with it?

Cedric: does anyone know that you have this?

Aurelia, just us, and another group of adventurers that we took it from

Valya but they don't know what the box contains

Cedric: but we must assume the Red Eagle knows what the box contains

Valya, but they don't know we have it

Cedric: So you're certain that nobody knows where it is, right now, except for your party... I'll leave it up to your judgement. The vault ehre is not so well protected as the vault in the temple in the shining citadel, but it does have some protections

Aurelia: There's already been an attempt to steal this artifact---I wouldn't be surprised if someone was smart enough to break in

Cedric if you believe it is safe with you, i would prefer not to endanger any of the members of this temple by housing such an artifact here. I don't mean to say your lives aren't valuable, but if someone tries to take it from you, perhaps you could learn something.

Valya (to Thaldohr) are you fine traveling with a trapped devil?

Thaldohr: as long as it stays trapped. I've dealt with monsters, not devils

Valya: is it possible for your order to send an expedition to Vargrath Keep?

Cedric: at the convening of the temples on [???], we had already decided to. We already have---in fact, the expedition shoul dhave returned last night. I am not privy to the results, but there will be a public announcement at the guardhouse this afternoon. I would be there, if I were you---there seem to be some big changes about to happen.

I have some paperwork to catch up on... the attack on the estate has not made this easier for anyone---there is much panic.

Aurelia: of course. and if you learn anything about valspira...

Cedric: I will have some of the sages check both our library and the other libraries in town that could be of use.

---

Buy rations before silverdale

Valya: (explains silverdale) we need to retrieve something from a blacksmiths

Thaldohr: blacksmithing and monsters, my two favorite subjects

Aurelia: apparently, they had quite a few log books lost during the tragedy. We need to bring them back... but we need Abundance to cast the spell to transport them, right?

Valya: I learned how to cast Tenser's floating disk as well.

Aurelia (to Thaldohr) we have some arcane magic users in the party...

Valya: it's hard to get used to the rules here

Thaldohr: as long as you don't cast them on me!

Valya: well, probably just healing spells from Aurelia

Aurelia: the blessings of Soleil are much more appreciated than the arcane arts.

Valya: if we're going to be using magic to store the books, it would be even better to find a bag of holding... but the only way to get such items is tyhrough Remy.

Aurelia: he won't be super happy if we don't bring him the shipment...

Valya: I have an idea! Remy knows us, but he doesn't know our new friend.

Aurelia: ahh, excellent

Valya (to Thaldohr) if we give you some coin, would you like to try purchasing some illegal goods from a suspicious character?

Thaldohr: if it helps, the party, i'll be willing to do that

Valya: and you're not going to run away with the gold right

Thaldohr: i have nowhere to go

Aurelia: I can visit Jonas and Dusk while you find Remy.

Valya: and I can buy rations for the trip

Valya gives Thaldohr 500 gp, says find Remy at the Drunken Goblin

---

Thaldohr gets a seat at Drunken Goblin, sees halfling come in about half an hour later, ilooking around, writing in a small notebook. 

Thaldohr finishes his drink, hops up to barstool one seat away, buys drink for Remy

Kind of you, do I know you?

No, I'm new to these parts, nice to meet you

Remy Wanderfoot, merchant, goods from pretty much all over Castalia, purchase goods at fair prices and sell them at even fairer prices.

What have you got for wares these days?

I have all sorts of interesting items, deal mostly in books, china, household goods, ask and maybe I have it

Hmm, could you tell me what kind of china you have?

Fine china used by the royalty of the Gemra Empire

Just a lowborn dwarf, don't know if I could carry such important items on my person

They're quite sturdy, let me show them to you, my wagon is just outside

Escorts to wagon

Pulls out drawers, he does actually have china

From the Gemra Empire itself, just there last time, currently at the hiehgt of fashion

Don't know that it would survive my journeys, traveling a lot

Have been looking for something that could... contain things

I have all manner of bags and boxes and pouches... but that wouldn't protect such fine china... you're looking for something exotic, arent you

Exactly how exotic

Pretty exotic

I have some items that you might say are... wondrous

I do have a sense of wonder, i wonder if you can fulful it

I think I can

Takes keys, opens lowest drawer, pulls out fine leather pouch

You seem like someone who values quality over all else. Perhaps even over... some restrictions, that are local to this country... this is a bag of holding. It's bigger on the outside, won't feel the bumps of the road. I mean, don't put rocks in after it, but surely you can figure that out.

That's fascinating! Sounds like a portal tummy, but outside of a person instead of inside.

Well I Haven't heard of such a thing myself, but, uh, this is certainly outside of a person.

Excellent! I've never been one for restrictions made by people who certainly don't follow them themselves.

Exactly, exactly, they try to protect people from the danger of magic, but it also protects them from the convenience. We all want convenience, which is why i have to ask; what do yu think a bag of holding is worth?

Oh, I hadn't thought of that before... but I would say, oh, maybe 250 gp?

Oh, well It took me quite a bit to procure this. The fellow that I bought this from---well, I didn't exactly buy it from him, more like... relieved it from him---let's just say I took it off of his body after he was killed in a dungeon. What can you do? Adventurers die all the time, I mean, he's not using it anymore. But it was a personal cost to me to enter that dungeon to relieve him and his fellows of their no-longer-needed goods. I think I would rather see 450 gp for this.

That does seem reasonable, given the great cost to you, but, I was thinking, maybe we could meet in the middle? What would you say about 375 gp.

375... I'll tell you what---375 for the bag of holding, and if you buy some china for 25 we'll call it a deal.

I like this bowl here, it seems like it would be good for my soups.

You have a discerning eye, that is one of the most prozed peices in this collection. Well... I don't have to wrap it up for you!

Puts bowl in bag od holding. Nice doing business with you. If you ever need anything else, just ask for me around the Drunken Goblin.

Of course, see you soon, friend.

Leaves with bag and bowl.

---

During this time, Valya goes to find some regular bags, rations, and, of course, dresses. She has been traveling for the last six months working as a sellsword, wants to splurge on some quality clothing.

---

Aurelia walks to the Blue Griffon to talk to Jonas and Dusk, it's in a not-so-nice area far from the center of town. She enters, there are a couple of patrons but doesn't see them. Goes to bartender to ask their whereabouts.

The human and the tiefling? I remember them, they looked a little beat up. You want a message sent to them?

Tell them Aurelia is waiting downstairs.

A few minutes later, Jonas and Dusk come down. Dusk is walking with a limp.

Aurelia. I take it you completed the shipment? Where is everyone else?

They're off shopping, but I thought I'd come by and give you your share.

Jonas: 25 gp, no less.

Aurelia: of course (hands gold)

Jonas: I guess you're true to your word.

Aurelia: are you faring alright?

Jonas: can't complain (dusk furrows brow)

Aurelia: did you experience any trouble on the road?

Dusk: we think we're being followed, ever since we got to crystalport

Jonas: you're so paranoid, dusk

Dusk: no, it's true! There's been a figure in a grey cloak, watching us from alleys, crowds... I don't know who it is, but I'm worried it has something to do with the shipment, we were attacked on the road

Aurelia: you would have been attacked again---we encountered some foolish students who were hired to intercept the shipment

Dusk: good that you had it and not us, then, i guess

Jonas: i guess you were right

Aurelia: i'm sorry for the loss of your companions.

Jonas: us too... we're going to return to Basinglen soon. Alix's family was there, so... have to tell them what happened. Thanks again.

Aurelia: of course. perhaps we'll meet again sometime.

Jonas: perhaps. we won't be back to crystalport any time soon, trying to lose whoever is tailing us

Aurelia. That seems wise. I'll be on the lookout for them as well. May the goddess look after you

Jonas: you as well

Dusk: thank you again

Aurelia leaves, looks around the square. Notices there is a man sitting on a stone bench, apears to be reading the daily paper but his eyes aren't moving and every so often he glances at the inn. Aurelia ducks into an alley and watches him for fifteen minutes, but is noticed---man locks eyes with Aurelia. Aurelia approaches, man looks away, ignores him. Aurelia sits down next to him.

Good afternoon

Afternoon, miss (turns page)

I see you've taken an interest in that inn.

Don't rightly know what you're talking about---interested in this paper here.

How much does the paper go for these days?

A silver piece

Just a silver... any interesting news?

There's an article here about the fiasco at the gala last night. Lots of crazy speculation. They say it was attacked by the wood scorpions.

Would you happen to know anything else about that?

I get the feeling you're insinuating something, miss

Just curious

I'm not so curious. Read that article, moved on to the next one. More interested in trading.

What goods do you trade.

Not goods, so much as betting on future prices. Need to stay on top of things if I want to make a profit.

So that's why you're interested in Jonas?

Aurelia notices he flinches a bit

I don't knwo what you're talking about, miss.

Of course. Is that why you're interested in the package they were transporting? Prices?

I suggest you leave before I call the town guard, miss.

Let me give you something for that paper, as an apology. (gives 1 sp) Perhaps you should move on. I think you won't find much more of use here.

I think you should move on, miss.

LStares after Aurelia as she leaves.

---

Reconvene at the guard house. There is a town crier in the main square saying there is going to be an announcement around 3pm. Filter in. Large open space in courtyard, platform set up, quite packed. Some guards come up to the platform, escorting a man in extremely fancy armor with royal insignia of Fentris family. Mages set up spell to project his voice. Behind the man is a woman with long hair, rust-colored robes, blindfold around her eyes.

Valya: ...doesn't she match the description of the woman Qhask saw in Tavin[???]?

A woman next to them: can you believe they've called in General Turlin Dahr.

Aurelia: from the capital?

Yes indeed! They say Atris of the Hammer teleported them in this morning! Something big must be brewing if the hammer is getting involved.

Valya gulps. The hammer?

The general clears his throat, magically magnified.

Last night, the organization known as the Wood Scorpions led an attack on the Daykin Estate with the aim of assassinating Prince Calvin, who has been enjoying the hospitality of the Duke and Duchess for several months. This was not the first attempt on the Prince's life. His bodyguard, Lythienne Pazana, as well as a group of adventurers present at the time, were able to bring the prince safely to the temple of Soleil, where they remained throughout the night. The Wood Scorpions fled soon after launching their attack. Three people---Lady Cressida Octalis, Lord Nash Grelburn, and a servant Irene Foote, were killed in the chaos. Several others sustained severe injuries. One Wood Scorpion was apprehended alive and is in our custody. He refuses to talk---we are waiting on the Queen to grant permission for Atris of the Hammer to read his mind. Discovering their hideout is our top priority. Troops from the capital are also being sent to deal with the rebels in the Osorin Forest---Crystalport has tolerated their interference with the trains for far too long.

Valua: I wonder if they capture Fergus.

General: any questions from the crowd?

A dwarven woman standing near the party, holding a quill and parchment, shouts out: what about the imps seen flying after the estate?

General: that appears to be merely rumor---all accounts we've heard are secondhand at best. If anyone personally witnessed these imps, I urge them to come forward, but until then, we are treating this rumor as baseless.

Someone else: wasn't the prince's fiance taken into custody as well?

I cannot comment on that at this time

Valya raises her hand. What about the rumors of necromancers in Vargrath Keep

I also cannot comment on that at this time.

Valya gets a creeping sensation on her skin, feels Atris is staring right at her through the blindfold.

A few questions later, Aurelia hears a voice in her mind. "The general would like to speak with you when this is over. Please, come. Bring your friends" (very quiet whisper).

Valya: what's happening?

Aurelia: I heard a voice. (can't tell, but feels like Atris is somehow looking at you). I think it's her. You attracted attention with her question.

Valya talks to Aurelia through her mind: I wonder why they're talking to you, then, and not to me

Aurelia: Maybe it's because I'm a priestess, i do tend to stand out

When there are no further questions, general and guards return inside, Atris turns to stare directly at them, then follow sguards inside.

Party enter, met by a squire who says "The general has been meaning to speak with you/ You are the adventurers, yes. He looks them over. Is this all of you?

A few of our group are elsewhere.

Well, nevertheless. Follow me.

He leads them to the war room where they spoke to Woodmore, see General Dahr at desk in back, brooding and serious, looks up.

General: you are the adventurers involved last night, yes?

Thaldohr: I wasn't there, but I am an adventurer

General dahr raises eyebrow. Fair enough. Motions them to gather round.

Tells rest of guards: please excuse us.

Thank you for helping bring the prince to safety. The royal family is quite grateful to you. I was sent in this morning to take control of the situation here in Crystalport, which seems to have gotten out of hand. Captain Woodmore has been asked to step down, and he has---I will be taking charge of the guard for the foreseeable future until the situation is under control.

Aurelia; by situation, you mean...

The wood scorpions of course.

Ah

I've heard some rumors about you. More specifically, rumors that have been spread *by* you. You've claimed that there is a lich in Vargrath Keep. You claim there is a hydra in Kyasha's Vale.

These are truths.

Well. A small expedition of three clerics were sent to Vargrath Keep to investigate. They returned yesterday, and they report that the place is abandoned. There is no sign of this supposed lich, no dungeon in the wine cellar where your friend was kept, or any of that. Merely some signs of recent vandalism, which is to be expected in any old ruin. I must ask; did you intend to help the wood scorpions in any way by spreading these rumors? Captain Woodmore was obsessed by the idea of fighting this hydra. He's known to be a... gulliuble man. Was it your intention to lure the guard away from the city?

Aurelia: of course not! we have proof that the hydra exists!

General: we have your *word*

Valya: we have *proof* (procures scale) this is from the hydra! we also have its eggshell (procures)

General: you *claim* it is from a hydra

Valya: we have no ties to the wood scorpions. our only intention was to bring peace to Kyasha's vale

General: you *claim* you have no ties to the wood scorpions.

Valya: we don't!

Aurelia: ...Fergus. Is that who you are talking about?

General: Indeed.

AQurelia: We had no idea he was working with them.

General (pauses). You must understand how suspicious this all looks. We have the princes fiance, leander, in custody. As it seems you knew. As it seems the *prince* knew. Prince Calvin is asking for leniency and for him to be remanded into his personal custody. (pauses, leans in, very serious). I've spoken to some witnesses this morning. There were two guards present during your altercation with Leander in the Prince's private quarters last night. They both claim that your Khorsirian friend, Abundance, cast a spell on Leander *moments* before he confessed to working for this supposed lich. I've checked with the Andirune Institute and the Crystalport Academy---neither of them authorized Abundance to use magic. I also checked the mage's registry---he didn't register as a mage upon entry to Crystalport. You realize how serious this seems, yes?

Aurelia: (looks at Valya) I thought you and Abundance had started at the academy?

General: you *started* at the academy, you have not yet *earned* ---

Valya: I'm waiting for my test, but I haven't yet made use of any magic.

General: but your friend Abundance, according to these two guards, *did*

Valya: we'll then you should be following---i'm *tired* of these accusations, we saved the prince and his fiance! if we were with the wood scorpions, would we have done that?

General: all i want to know is the current whereabouts of your friends Fergus O'Toole and Abundance.

Valya: we don't know

Aurelia: Abundance left our party this morning, we don't know when he slipped out

General: and you don't find this suspicious?

Aurelia: i mean, sure, that could be suspicious

General: i believe we have to assume that Fergus and Abundance are working for the wood scorpions. They have been spreading rumors of liches and hydras to destabalize crystalport and pave the way for an attack on prince calvin

Valya: why is it so hard to belive there are other threats besides the wood scorpions?

General: the clerics sent to investigate the keep report it abandoned.

Aurelia: that can't be possible, we were just there

Valya: leander could have passed along a message to them? he's wokring for the lich, and a spellcaster

General: *he* has a valid license to do so. until we have abundance for questioning, we don't know if leander is subject to outside forces. everything leander says is suspect right now.

Aurelia: you really think Abundance forced a false confession?

General: based on the evidence, that is a strong prossibility.

Aurelia: we've only traveled with him for a brief period of time, but he seemed like decent person.

General: if you've only known him a short time, you don't know what he's capable of or where his true intentions lie. How well do you really know your friends?

Everyone looks around awkwardly, especially at Thaldohr.

General: well. if any of them attempt to contact you in the coming days, we would like to know about it. priestess, i am sorry for dragging you into this. you three are not officially suspected of committing any crime. But any information you have about Abundance or Fergus would be invaluable.

Aurelia: I know your focus is on the wood scorpions, but these other threats... we've seen them with our own euyes.

General: if you have any convincing evidence, I'd love to hear it. but in the meantime, my job is to get the wood scorpions under control. find their hideout, root them out, arrest all of them. i have much work to do . you are dismissed.

---

Valya (to Thaldohr) Sorry to drag you into this (explains wood scorpions to Thaldohr)

Aurelia: do you think either of them were actually using us?

Valya; Fergus and Harmony asked us to go to Vargrath Keep in the first place...

Aurelia: And it is odd that Fergus and Harmony met up again in Crystlport...

Valya: he did have some radical tendencies... and he spread propaganda in Kyasha's vale...

Suddenly, while walking back to temple "excuse me!"

It's the dwarven woman who asked the question about the imps.

"**Katavrena Steelgrip**, with the Citadel Sentinel. Do you have a few moments to answer a few questions?

Aurelia: I'd prefer not to speak to---

Surely you'd like the people to hear your side of the story?

Valya: (speaks to aurelia mentally) I'd prefer not to talk publically, you know why, i don't want people to know im here.

Aurelia: all I will say is that we are glad to have helped protect the prince.

Kat: wonderful (scribbling on paper) but just one question: multiple eyewitnesses say they've seen you in the company of the younger sister of the notorious wood scorpion dylan grove. you took a boat to Vargrath Keep togeher, is that correct? Is that a woodscorpion hideout? DId you meet dylan there?

Aurelia: (flabbergasted) that is slander (begins to walk away)

Kat: i don't think it is, you *were* seen with harmony grove, were you not (walking after them) they say you met her in kyasha's notch, during this time of year its completely blocked by snow, why were you there, isn't it suspicious? you took a boat ride with her? to fight a lich, if the rumors are to be believed? is the lich a wood scorpion

Aurelia: what?

Kat: how do you respond to the accusations that you're spreading rumors about hydras, demons, and the undead in order to instill panic, destabilize the city, and pave the way for a hostile Thamorian invasion?

Valya: what???

Aurelia: excuse me???

Kat: I'm not *accusing* you of anything, I'm just asking the questions that our readers want answered.

Aurelia: well you should tell your readers that they should keep their imaginations to more useful ends

Kat: scribbling furiously. i have one more question. why were you in the prince's private quarters during the attack?

Aurelia: ...

Kat: well, i think i have enough for now, thank you for your time. if you'd like to talk further, ask for me at the Citadel Sentinel branch near the city center. It's been great talking to you!

Aurelia: (stunned)

Thaldohr: Hi, Im thaldohr, nice to see a fellow dwarf in these parts. I wasn't with them last night, but could tyou tell me, who is asking you about these rumors?

Kat: well i have to protect my sources

Thaldphr: well, you see, i've just met this group, and you have me concerned a bit.

Kat: if you want to have afurther conversation, just ask for me! (walks away)

Valya: the traditions of this land escape my understanding... we've been *helping* people.

Thaldohr: sorry if I came across as untrusting, I was just ttrying to figure out where these rumors are coming from so we could investigate ourselves.

Aurelia: i just don't understand why antyone would seek to slander adventurers who are just trying to help people

Valya: the crazier the story, the better it sells, right? i've seen things like this in Thamior too. but being *involved* in it is not somehting i was expdctiong

Aurelia: well, we should try to stay out of the public eye for a bit.

Valya: i agree. but this does confirm that Harmony was a terrorist. maybe she inducted Fergus, and they were *planning* to meet in the city?

Aurelia: i can't believe we had a wood scorpion in our party. perhaps we should leave town for a little bit. we were talking about going to silverdale.

Valya: and my brother might be involved. we should go as soon as possible, or i might lose my chance of seeing him. oh! i remembered, i bought clothing for you two.

Aurelia: i thought you were getting supplies

Valya: well... i got distracted.

Aurelia: how much did you spend?

Valya: money comes and goes, it's irrelevant... only a few hundred

Aurelia: I was hoping the funds from the prince would last us quite a while

Valya: well, once we find out what (looks at Thaldohr) happened to my family, I'm sure I can use my family's funds... I'll be more than happy to personally fund our journeys.

Aurelia: well, let's go shopping for supplies before it gets too dark.

Thaldohr: oh, speaking of shopping, look at this cool bowl I got!

Valya: is that from the Gemra Empire?

Thaldohr: it is!

Valya: it's very fashionable

Aurelia: you used our money to buy a bowl???

Thaldohr: oh! yes, yes, I also bought this! and here's your change

Aurelia: I'll take hold of that (takes bag of holding), it's less likely that they'll search me.

buy rations and supplies for trip to silverdale, then go eat at a restaurant at Valya's suggestion (tired of rations)

---

Go back to see Jonas to talk about the guy who was tailing them, nowhere to be seen

Dusk: oh, didn't expect to see you so soon

Aurelia: we found someone watching the inn, there definitely is someone following you, waiting for you to leave. i think it's about that package

Dusk: what have we gotten ourselves into... we'll leave tonight for basinglen... thank you for the warning.

---

Eat at the Mithril Spoon, influences from Amyanthalas but also on local seafood. Pricy. 0.5 gp each. Valya covers. Sit down at low table, no chairs

Valya asks waitress about rumors about imps at Daykin estate.

"Oh, my brother's friend says he saw them with his own eyes! Quite scary, he says. Flapping bat wings. Do you think the wood scorpions trained them? Or what if Asmodeus is involved, what if devils are conspiring agains thte royal family?

Valya: Do the Daykin's come to this place?

I heard they did last year, but I wasn't wokring here at the time.

Do they go anywhere else?

I wouldn't know, I'm just the waiter---above my paygrade.

But waiters hear things... (leaves gp tip)

Oh! Well, I have heard some things, what do you want to know?

Anything about the Daykins, surely there's somehtinh you could tell me

Well... you didn't hear this from me, but my friend works at the Golden Goblet, and she says, a few months ago the Duchess and several of her friends had a meal there one night, and, well, no one said anything about it, but my friend says the Duchess smelled like sulphur.

Well, I guess we'll make plans at the Golden Goblet

Ask for Elyse

What was your name?

Marie

Thank you Marie

10 gp

Eyes go wide, thank you!

Valya: this is why we went to this dinner. if you're going to move among high society, you need to know how to get information about your peers

Aurelia: we're moving among high society now?

Valya: i'm tired of hiding

## Sunday, December 9, 652 AU

The next morning, Valya tells the rest of the party about a vision she had overnight.

> Fergus and a middle-aged man with short brown hair and the look of a mercenary are sitting on opposite sides of a desk in a cramped office lit by a single lantern. Fergus has his back to the door, which is guarded by two hooded figures.
> 
> "I am... displeased that you and Harmony went behind my back," says the older man. "I told you to abandon the teleportation plan, and yet you two persisted. The truth is, Fergus, we can't let the hydra be killed."
> 
> "What?" ask Fergus, confused. "Why not?"
> 
> "If the Pool were restored, Crystalport would do everything in its power to bring it under their control, to 'protect' it. Such powerful healing magic... it would end up under the control of the very people we are trying to fight. That is an advantage I am not willing to let them have.
> 
> "I was wondering what to do with you... you disobeyed my direct orders. Ordinarily..." Perrit trails off and stares.
> 
> "But it seems fortune has smiled upon us both. You can still be useful to us after all—Captain Woodmore has invited you and your friends to the upcoming gala.” He opens a drawer of his desk, reaches in, then pushes a small dagger and a wooden figurine shaped like a scorpion across the table to Fergus.
> 
> Fergus stares for a moment at the knife. "I see."
> 
> “The dagger is laced with wyvern poison as an extra measure. The figurine is a token of refuge—snap it and you will be instantly teleported to our safe house. They won’t suspect you. You’ll have done the people of Castalia a great favor, Fergus.”
> 
> He pauses. “This will be a clean operation. But if, for whatever reason, you were to fail to kill the Prince, we would have a strike team ready and waiting outside. I’d prefer not to have to use them. They tend to be… messy."
> 
> "...I'll do what must be done," Fergus says slowly, and nods.

I haven't had a vision like this before.

Aurelia: perhaps it is solieil helping us?

Valya: why would she send a vision to me?

Aurelia: i'm sure she has her reasons. do you know where the vision took place?

Valya: It was a basement, I think... but I don't know where.

Aurelia: I can't believe anyone would withhold healing magic from the people for such ulterior motives.

Valya: i'll tell you something of the politics in Thamior sometime.

They start heading along the road to Rimehollow around Corentin's Mirror. It's a chilly morning, their breath visible. They pass farmers bringing gourds and other late-season vegetables to market before winter truly sets in.

After a few hours, they make it to Rimehollow, they decide to pass right through on their way to Silverdale.

North of Rimehollow, they're stopped by a middle-aged peasant.

"I would avoid the north if I were you, travelers. Surely you've heard the rumors.

Of walking dead (Aurelia)

Oh, even worse!

Valya: what do you mean

Man: there are things there worse than the undead, shadow people, undead beasts, don't think there aren't undead wolves! You can hear them howl.

Valya: do they ever come near town?

By the grace of corentin, no

Aurelia: thank you for the warning

Valya: have any other adventurers come by?

A trio of clerics a few days ago, of corentin, soleil, and neesha

Any lone elves?

Can't say that I did

Oh, now that you mention it, a boat went up the river maybe a month ago. I just hope they went up the river Lune at the fork, many like hunting there. But the boat was curious---as far as I could tell, it was unmanned. Figured it was wizards from crystalport.

Appreciate the information (aurelia)

Not enough to heed it, i suppse, but can't change adventurers minds

Continue north for an hour and a half

The trail to the north is no longer maintained, mostly mud, and as they head north, the farmland gives way to forest and the trail disappears into the underbrush.

Thaldohr notices that up in the canopy, through the brown and orange leaves, there are giant spiderwebs.

Aurelia: those must be large spiders

Valya: hopefully they have better prey than us

Suddenly, Aurelia and Valya are each hit by a spray of web from somewhere up in the trees. Two ettercaps have descended from the trees, stopping twenty feet above the ground. Aurelia burns the web, freeing herself. One of the ettercaps skitters down from the trees, biting Aurelia, who shakes off the effects of its poison. It then swipes at Aurelia with a claw, but misses.

The other ettercap skitters down to bite Thaldohr, and misses, but then successfully slashes Thaldohr with its claws. Thaldohr swings his warhammer at the ettercap in retaliation, cracking its carapice.

Valya casts *sword burst* to free herself from the web, then rushes next to Aurelia and casts *hex* on the adjacent ettercap.

Aurelia casts *burning hands* at the ettercap, then heals herself.

The ettercap, seeing that Aurelia is still the more damaged one, swipes at Aurelia and attempts to bite her, but misses with both attacks.

The other one manages to get a claw through Thaldohrs armor, but misses with its bite.

Thaldorh swings his warhammer again, but misses.

Valya casts *booming blade* and swings her sword at the spider, but misses. She then drops her sword and brings out Soul-Snatcher, her double-bladed scimitar.

Aurelia casts another *healing word* on herself, then casts *sacred flame* at the ettercap. The ettercaps, at this point, have significant gouges and burns, but seem undaunted.

The ettercap shoots another web at Aurelia, ensnaring her once again, then begins tragging Aurelia up the tree, shrugging off Valya's retaliatory attack as it passes by.

Valya: you monster, bring back aurelia!

The other ettercap throws another web at Thaldohr, then skitters up a tree with him.

Thaldohr swings his warhammer, but doesn't hit the spider.

Valya casts *lightning lure*, pulling the spider and Aurelia back to the ground and singing the ettercap with lightning.

Aurelia trapped in a web and lying on the ground, casts *sacred flame* at the ettercap, but misses, then casts *shield of faith*.

The ettercap tries to attack Valya, but misses.

Thaldohr swings his warhammer, and this time he hits, cracking the ettercap's carapace even further.

Valya swings her double-bladed scimitar at the ettercap, which falls to the ground, motionless. Then Valya swings at the web around Aurelia, but as her scimitar does psychoc damage, it has no effect, so instead, she begins to run toward the other ettercap, climbing to a branch under Thaldohr.

Aurelia tries to burn the web, but isn't able to fully remove it.

The other ettercap shoots a web at Valya, but Valya manages to dodge, so the ettercap continues to climb the tree.

Thaldohr tries to cut himself free of the web, so he'll have a hand free if he falls, but his hammer does nothing against the web.

Valya drops her scimitar and begins climbing up the tree after the ettercap, then uses another *lightning lure* to pull the ettercap down to a lower branch. The ettercap is brought near death by the attack.

Aurelia fully frees herself from the web, then runs to the base of the tree with the remaining ettercap, picking up Valya's dropped scimitar.

The ettercap bites Valya, who manages to shake off the poison. Thaldohr swings his hammer at the ettercap, but misses again. Valya teleports her scimitar back to her hand, then casts *booming blade* and attacks the spider, which partially explodes, then falls to the ground.

Valya lowers Thaldohr to the ground by his web, where Aurelia frees him with her dagger.

Thaldohr: thank you!

Aurelia: are you injured?

Thaldohr: just a bruise.

Aurelia casts prayer of healing.

Valya inspects the webs in the nearby trees. It seems the ettercaps have mostly been eating small birds and squirrels, but in one web, she notices some movement. "Are you okay" No response. Valya cuts the web, and out of it falls an undead rabbit, which hisses at Valya and lunges at her. Valya casts another sword burst and the zombie rabbit dies.

Aurelia tries to extract venom from the ettercaps, but without alchemist's supplies or a poisoner's kit, she punctures the poison sack.

They continue through the forest, and soon they find themselves on the outskirts of Silverdale. Among the trees are old farmhouses, covered in vines, partially collapsed. A pile of bricks lies nearby, the remains of a collapsed chimney. Although the trees begin to thin out as they enter the town proper, some trees have managed to grow through the cobblestones here and there. A chill breeze passes through the trees, but they don't see any movement, living or undead.

Aurelia scouts ahead, removing her brooch of living essence in case it helps her blend in with the undead

Valya (in mind) This should let us communcate for a short while

Aurelia: did you learn this at the academy? how are you doing this?

Valya: i've always had a knack for this sort of thing. this wil only last a few mintes

Aurelia tries to stealthily move further into town while Valya tells Thaldohr about Aurelia's encounter with the gelatinous cube, theorizing that Aurelia actually died but was brought back by Soleil.

Aurelia notices old dead bodies on the streets, former undead with arrows stuck in them, presumably from crystalport guard. Aurelia finds 30 zombies in the twon square, just standing there, not moving. They don't notice her. She also notices that each of the zombies has a shiny ring on their finger, untarnished by rust. She also notices that on the opposite side of the square is a luxurious estate with a smithy on its left side. Aurelia tries to walk around the town square, giving it a wide berth.

Suddenly, out of nowhere, she feels ice-cold claws rake across her back. She stifles a scream to avoid attracting the undead, turns, and doesn't see anyone before she faints from the sudden shock.

Valya notices that her link to Aurelia suddenly drops, and she and Thaldohr run after her. They see the undead in the town square, but Aurelia is nowhere to be seen. Valya looks for footprints, and after searching around for a few minutes finds fresh bloodstains on the ground, along with signs that Aurelia's body has been dragged into a nearby house.

Valya sneaks up to the broken window and sees a very strange scene.

---

Aurelia, waking back up, finds herself in an old house, propped up in a chair. In front of her, on an old table, is a set of chipped tea cups and a kettle, all empty. In a chair across from Aurelia is a set of clothing, worn by an invisible person. A moth-eaten floral hat, a string of pearls, and a mismatched set of clothing. Aurelia hears "huhh. *huhhh*" as a teacup floats in the air towards her. "huhh! huuuuhh!"

Aurelia takes the teacup, disturbed, and another teacup soon floats up to the invisible creature's face. It pretends to take a sip from the teacup, "uuuughhhgh". Aurelia also pretends to take a sip, and the creature makes a noise resembling a laugh and then begins mumbling unintelligible nonsense. Aurelia sees Valya watching through the window.

Valya: (to Thaldohr) what the heck?

Valya (to aurelia) are you okay? What's going on

Aurelia: i have no idea, this creature attacked me and i woke up here.

The creature tries to hold a fake conversation with Aurelia while sipping tea

Suddenly, another one of these things wearing a set of fancy clothing enters the room, picking up another teacup in its invisible hands. It, too, joins in the nonsensical "conversation".

Valya: what should we do

Aurelia: help me!

Valya: can you try talking to these tings?

Aurelia: they only grunt

Aurelia tries to pantomime finishing her tea and getting up as if to leave, but an invisible arm pulls her back into her seat and forces the teacup back in her hands, then pretends to pour more tea from the teapot.

Aurelia: well, i can't leave. help!

Valya goes to the door and kicks it open, "let her go!" she rushes in, then kicks the table. all the china falls to the ground and shatters. she gets in front of aurelia and points her scimitar at the creatures.

Not the china (thaldohr)

Valya feels claws along her back, attacked by a third creature that wasn't wearing clothes.

Thaldohr climbs in through the broken window, and notices that he can see the creatures' reflections in the shattered glass on the floor. He swings with his warhammer at one of the clothed creatures, but misses.

The creature retaliates by slashing at Thaldohr, and the other one wraps an arm around Aurelia as if to protect her, then slashes at Valya, dealing massive damage in a critical hit. Aurelia channels divinity to cast *turn undead*, dealing enough radiant damage to destroy the creatures.

Thaldohr tells them about the glass, and Valya uses a shard to look at them. Aurelia thinks they might be skulks---soulless shells of travelers lost in the shadowfell, pantomiming their former lives.

Aurelia casts another *prayer of healing*, and they decide to rest for a while in this abandoned house. Aurelia explains that she saw the smithy on the other side of the square. They take a look around the house. It appears to have been the home of a moderately wealthy merchant family. In an adjacent room are three bodies, shredded to death by claws. They appear to have been adventurers. Valya thinks they've been here a year. On their bodies they find rope, pickaxes, crowbars, and a collapsible shovel. Aurelia performs last rites. Presumably raiders looking for loot.

---

Twenty minutes into their rest, they hear the fluttering of wings, and then a thump on the roof. A minute or so later, there's more fluttering, and then nothing. After their rest, it's late afternoon, and they make thier way toward the smithy.

Aurelia: we should be quick---we should be out of here before sunset.

Soon find themselves at the back of this manor with the attached forge. The forge is on the western side of the manor, but they are approaching it from the east. In the east is a garden, surrounded by a tall wall. Aurelia hears a low, moaning cry coming from somewhere within the garden. She gets up on Valya's shoulders to peer over the wall, but isn't able to see anything through the dense, overgrown foliage. The sobbing continues.

The front of the manor, to the south, is open to the zombie-infested town square, so they try the back of the manor in the north. The back appears to be another enclosed garden, with the wall fallen down in several places. There is a servant's entrance in the wall of the manor, beyond the wall.

They sneak inside the back garden, and peer through the windows. They see guest bedrooms, once luxurious, now dilapidated and damaged by a century of disuse. Valya boosts Thaldohr through a broken window, then Valya and Aurelia follow after him. They open the door and find a hallway, littered with bodies, all former undead with arrows sticking out of them. The hallway opens up to a large hall, decorated with a mosaic of the Kildare family crest. The walls have the remains of tapestries displaying dwarven smiths.

The bodies, many of which are missing limbs, prove inert. They open a few doors in the hall, looking for an office or library where the books are stored, but they find more guest rooms. Trying the other end of the hall, they find a door opening on to the smithy, which is a large roofed area open to the town square. Anvils, forges, etc. fill the area. Judging by the disarray and the bodies scattered around, the forge was in operation when the catastrophe struck.

They can see through the door that there is another door from the forge to another area to teh north, but they don't want to leave the manor and attract the zombies in the square.

They head up the stairs in the main hall, and open the double doors at the top of the landing. Inside are two animate zombies, which turn dumbly to stare at the party. They're wearing tattered rags that were once noble dress. They moan and begin stumbling toward the party. Valya rushes forward and slashes at the zombie, which moans angrily. Aurelia casts *sacred flame* at it, and Thaldohr swings at another zombie with his warhammer, knocking off its head. However, the head just rolls toward Thaldohr and bites his leg. The rest of the zombie continues stumbling around.

Valya slashes at one of the zombies, and Aurelia finishes it off with another *sacred flame*. Thaldohr continues swinging at the zombie torso, severing an arm. The remaining arm swings at Thaldohr, while the severed arm crawls toward Aurelia and tries to grab her ankle. Valya runs over to Thaldohr and stabs through the head with her scimitar. Aurelia disintegrates the severed arm with another *sacred flame* and Thaldohr finishes off the torso. 

The room they find themselves in turns out to be a library. Many of the books like rotted on the floor, damaged by water dripping through the ceiling. Searching through the remaining books, they appear to be romance and adventure novels.

"Oh, my favorite," says Thaldohr.

Aurelia looks through the drawers of the desk in the back of the library, but finds they're locked. Valya picks the lock, and opens the drawer. Inside are several pieces of parchment and a nice, leatherbound green book, safe from water damage. It's title is Kildare, 558-II, and inside is a sales log, detailing all the special orders in the summer of 558 AU. It's completely filled---presumably there is a III somewhere.

Aurelia: this must be one of the books we're after, but where are the rest?

The rest of the drawers contain office supplies.

They take some time to more thoroughly browse through the library, and Valya finds, in between an elven romance novel and a list of great deeds of Castalian heroes, is *The Great Smithies of Castalia*. They pocket it, then Valya searches through the corpses, finding jewelry containing 3 sardonyx pieces, a pouch containing 15gp 210sp 93cp, and in the pocket of the man is an elixir of health with an old faded label that says "for your cough, dr. ..." (faded), and a keychain with several keys.

Moving on to the adjacent rooms (and being careful to listen to the doors), they find more guest rooms, more bodies shot with arrows, doors are wide open, find:

- 34 gp
- 140 sp
- 300 cp
- beautiful star rose quartz earrings

Go back downstairs, entry room on other side of hall, with sitting room, back of sitting room has windows opening on to the garden.

Valya: if the upper floor and back of the first are residential, maybe the front here has the office.

Valya approaches the window, hears the sobbing. Half-hidden among the overgrown vegetation, Valya spies something---a patch of human skin through the weeds. Is someone lying on the ground out there? But as soon as she blinks, it suddenly darts further into the underbrush. The crying abruptly stops.

They decide to explore the other rooms around this main entrance hall

Near the main entrance is a coatroom, with several coats.

Valya starts rifling through the pockets. Suddenly, something shakes her hand! She quickly pulls her hand out, to find another hand grabbing her. Four more crawling claws jump out of the pockets of the cloaks, each taking a swipe at Valya. Everyone is surprised, and the claws each take another attack on Valya, bringing her near death.

"Get these things off me!"

Thaldohr swings his hammer, crushing one of the claws against the tile floor. Valya casts *sword burst*, destroying the remaining hands.

Valya continues searching, finding a chrysoprase bracelet, 10 gp, 100 sp, 50 cp.

Aurelia: hopefully you've learned a lesson about robbing the dead.

Valya, noticing that the front door of the manor is unlocked, locks and bars it with chairs in case the zombie horde is later alerted to their presence.

They head down another hall, looking for a way into the garden, and find a salon with a fountain, and a door out to the garden. On the opposite side from the garden are two doors, slightly ajar. As they approach the doors, they hear undead moaning. They approach the other door, and find a master bedroom. A corpse in the room, peppered with arrows, is wearing a ring with the crest of the Kildare family. Valya pockets it, and also finds sardonyx pieces and more gold. The room itself has several dressers and the remains of a fancy canopy bed. In the back of the bedroom are two more doors. Valya peers into this washroom, and finds the tub is filled to the brim with severed limbs.

Valya: why is there a tub of limbs???

Aurelia: there's some very dark necromancy in this place.

They approach the room next to the master bedroom, and find a limbless zombie moaning on the floor. They decide not to make noise, walk around it, and in the room, find a fancy bottle of oil.

Aurelia: the only place we haven't checked is that room north of the forge.

Valya: should we distract the zombies?

Aurelia: it's strange that their office would be inaccessible from the manor without going outside... maybe there's a secret door?

They investigate the hall adjacent to the room in question, and Thaldohr discovers a crack hidden in the mortar, and with some more searching they find a stone that can be depressed. There's a click, and the wall swings open onto an office. The walls are decorated with shelves and shelves of antique blacksmithing tools. There's a desk in the center of the room, and a two doors---one with thick glass opening up onto the forge, and another heavy wooden door reinforced with iron bands on the opposite wall.

Additionally, they notice that all noise of wind immediately stops when they cross into the office. It seems the room is magically shielded from outside noise.

There is another green leather-bound tome lying on the desk, but no other books. The tome says Kildare 558-III. Some more exploration reveals some crystal vials on a shelf. Valya pockets them, then uses the keys they found to open the desk drawers. Inside, she finds sketches and blueprints of weapons, which she also pockets.

The keys don't work on the iron door, so Valya tries to pick the lock with her thieve's tools. However, her hand slips. The good news is that the lockpicking tools aren't broken. The bad news is that they can suddenly hear noises from outside the room, and one of those noises is an ear-piercing alarm. Suddenly, they hear groaning---the zombies outside are now stumbling toward them. Additionally, they hear the sound of a crowd rushing down the halls of the manor toward them---they grimly guess that it's the mass of limbs in the tub, now alerted to their presence.

Aurelia reacts first. She casts *bless* on the party, then swings the secret passage shut. Valya tries to pick the lock again, and manages to open it this time. She pulls open the door, and they find a spiral staircase to somewhere below. She rushes down the stairs. Thaldohr follows behind her, and Aurelia follows them. They hear a loud boom as something crashes into the secret door, and Aurelia swings the secret door closed behind her.

The stairs go down 15 feet, and Valya discovers another door at the bottom, this one made of metal. It does not have a visible lock, but has the crest of the Kildare family etched into it. She tries messing with the two sconces on either side of the door, but they appear to be bolted into the wall and not part of any secret mechanism.

Valya, in a flash of insight, takes the Kildare ring out of her pocket and touches it to the door, and the door flashes and swings open. Inside, they find another library---rows and rows of green leather books, each marked with a year. These are the books they came for. Can they get out of here with them, alive. They rush into the room and start picking up books and throwing them into the bag of holding.

Meanwhile, up above, they hear the zombies pounding on the door to the forge, and another large crash as the mass of limbs throws itself against the secret door.

Looking around, they also find, in the corner, a shortsword resting on a stand---it is quite fancy, and has the Kildare family crest on the pommel. It goes in the bag too.

Aurelia closes the vault door behind them. The noise of the thumping is greatly reduced. Eventually, after ten minutes, they have thrown all the books into the bag of holding. They hear a deafening boom---the mass of limbs has finally broken down the secret door.

After several more minutes, the alarm drops. The only sound is the thudding of the zombies pounding on the door.

Valya: ready to open the door and fight that thing?

Aurelia: it's almost night time---maybe we should spend the night in this vault and escape in the morning.

It's difficult to relax, with the constant pounding of the zombies, but they spend the night in the vault.

## Monday, December 10, 652 AU

The following morning, the banging noises from the xombies have lessened. It sounds like there are only a few zombies left---the others must have wandered off throughouth the night. The mass of limbs hasn't made any noise the whole night; they wonder where it is.

They exit the vault, and find the stairwell empty. They make their way to the top of the stairs. Aurelia carefully studies the magical sigils on this side of the door---it seems that the alarm won't trigger if opened from this side. Valya casts *armor of agathys* on herself as a precaution, then opens the door. Sunlight streams through the other door onto the ground, illuminating the pile of limbs. Unfortunately, Aurelia and Thaldohr have been making noise, and the pile of limbs begins flowing toward Valya.

Thaldohr rushes forward and tries to swing at the limbs, but misses---it lunges at Thaldohr in return and deals massive bludgeoning damage, grappling him in the process. Valya teleports next to the mass of limbs, gaining resistance to physical damage, and attacks, but also misses. Aurelia casts *bless* on the party.

Thaldohr brings his warmhammer down on the limbs and makes contact, crunching some of the bones. He swings a second time, landing a critical hit, but there are many limbs. It tries to reach out at Valya, but misses; then, Thaldohr feels the hands grappling him turn ice-cold. He manages to resist whatever strange effect.

Valya swings her scimitar at it twice, and Aurelia casts *guiding bolt* at the limbs, dealing a massive amount of radiant damage. All the while, the remaining zombies outside continue to batter the door ineffecually.

Thaldohr hits the limbs again with his warhammer, and the limbs try to hit Thaldohr in return, but miss. Thaldohr again feels the cold, and takes some necrotic damage, both healing the creature and reducing Thaldohr's hit point maximum.

Valya swings her scimitar, striking the limbs twice. The limbs are flailing, broken, and bloody, and they think the unholy abomination is close to death. Aurelia casts *sacred flame*, but misses.

Thaldohr swings his warhammer, and with that final blow, the creature collapses into a pile of limbs... out of which crawl six more crawling claws! Three claw at Valya, but they are each destroyed in retaliation by her *armor of agathys*. The other three attack Thaldohr, but each misses. Valya destroys two of the remaining crawling claws with one swing of her scimitar each, and Aurelia destroys the last with a *sacred flame*.

Aurelia notices that only three zombies remain near the door, and each is wearing a new-ish looking silver band. She also notices that on the other side of the courtyard, on the balcony of a ruined building, is a woman. She is wearing all black, including a floral hat of black roses and ravens' feathers, and is watching them through opera glasses. She puts down her teacup and waves at Aurelia. Aurelia ducks back out of view.

"We need to leave. *Now*. There's a woman out there, and she seems to be either a more advanced undead or a necromancer."

"Almost certainly a necromancer---these limbs aren't your average undead." Valya searches through the limbs, and finds a silver ring on one of the arms. She inspects it---it's a plain silver band, with an inscription; *M. and F. Talos*. "Oh! This is the same as the ring we found at Vargrath Keep!" She pockets the ring.

Aurelia: We'll investigate this further once we return to Crystalport. She knows we're here, but perhaps we can lose her in the forest.

Valya: if she's just drinking tea, how do we know she'll even attack us?

Aurelia looks back out the window---the woman is nowhere in sight. "Oh dear."

Valya: okay, let's get out of here. She casts *armor of agathys* again.

They sneak their way back out of the manor, around the town square, and back toward the old road to Rimehollow. However, ten minutes later they hear howling behind them. They're close, and getting closer.

Knowing they can't outrun wolves, they decide to climb the trees. A minute later, the wolves appear. They're definitely undead.

The wolves don't look like ordinary undead wolves. One is missing its lower jaw.

Thaldohr shoots the other with a crossbow, but it swiftly dodges out of the way. It then runs to the base of the tree, and begins climbing the tree---they notice it doesn't have normal paws, but instead it has strange mucus-covered suction cup-like appendages. It attempts to bite Thaldohr, but Thaldohr pulls his leg out of the way.

The other wolf, with the missing jaw, gurgles, and ejects a spray of acid from its mouth that hits the entire party. Aurelia casts *spiritual weapon*, placing it next to the jawless wolf. However, the weapon misses. She then casts *fire bolt*, which does hit, and singes its fur.

Valya climbs down the tree to attack the jawless wolf, striking it twice with her scimitar. Thaldohr strikes the climbing wolf with his warhammer in the face, and it attempts to bite him in retaliation, but can't get through Thaldohr's armor. The other wolf swings its claws at Valya, catching her in the leg and knocking her prone, but the wolf takes damage in return from *armor of agathys*.

Aurelia casts *bless* on the party, then attacks the jawless wolf with her *spiritual weapon*, which hits this time. Valya hits the jawless wolf with her scimitar, which whimpers and collapses, and then hits the other wolf. Thaldohr hits the remaining wolf with his hammer. It retaliates, but again cannot get through Thaldohr's armor.

Aurelia misses the wolf with the spiritual weapon, but follows it up with a *fire bolt* that hits true.

Far in the distance, they hear a female voice: "Yoo-hoo! New friends! Please don't make me come after you. Have you met my pets? They'll bring you back to me. Maybe not all in one piece, but I can stitch you back together!"

Valya, distracted by the voice, misses both of her attacks, but Thaldohr manages to crush the wolf's head, and it falls to the ground, motionless.

They climb down from the trees and begin running as fast as they can toward Rimehollow...
