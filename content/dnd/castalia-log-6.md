*Played on 2023-11-26.*

## Thursday, December 6, 652 AU, continued

It's getting late in the afternoon, so the party decides to ask Gordon for two rooms at the temple of Corentin for the night. Their rooms arranged, they return to the stable where they left their horses. Finlay, the owner, agrees to buy the horses for 50 gp. Finally, they confront Bodo. Although he's adamant that they're all just meddlers and that Riley deserves to be punished, the weight of the evidence for her innocence eventually convinces him that *maybe* Riley isn't *totally* responsible for everything. Good enough!

Back in their makeshift room at the temple, Abundance opens the scroll of *Tenser's floating disk* and begins tattoing his arm, periodically consulting the scroll.

"What are you doing?" asks Valya.

"Copying the spell," responds Abundance. "Some wizards use books to hold their spells... I've found that this method suits me better."

While Abundance continues his tattooing, they debate what to do about the shipment. If they do decide to take it for themselves, should they bring it to its intended destination, the Red Eagle company? Or should they hand it off to Remy? Or open it themselves?

"We *could* open it," says Valya. "Although it might be dangerous."

"That's exactly why we *should* open it," says Abundance. "What if it's a powerful magical artifact? We don't want it to fall into the wrong hands, and this whole business is rather shady."

"If it's dangerous, we shouldn't open it at all," says Aurelia. "We should bring it to the Red Eagle. I don't trust Remy."

"Remy is willing to pay a lot more than the Red Eagle," says Qhask. "Red Eagle only pays 50 gp, but Remy's offering *three* magic items!"

"That's assuming he keeps his word," says Aurelia.

"We don't know *anything* about Red Eagle!" says Valya. "At least we've *met* Remy."

They're still undecided by the time they turn in for the night, but they know one thing---if they don't take the shipment for themselves, Jonas and Dusk are going to get killed for it on the road to Crystalport, and this unknown third party will have it.

## Friday, December 7, 652 AU

The next morning, they speak to Jonas and Dusk again.

"So, you're taking it," says Jonas.

"Yes," says Aurelia. "Those bandits who attacked you will probably strike again, and you're in no shape to fight." Dusk nods in agreement, but Jonas scowls.

"Meet us at the Blue Griffin in Crystalport, two days from now," says Jonas. "We want our cut."

"We'll see you there," Aurelia promises.

They thank Gordon again for his hospitality, then take to the road. They load the crate and the evil statue onto Abundance's *floating disk*, then cover it all with a tarp.

With Maplethorn behind them, Abundance convinces the rest of the party that they should just *check* what's in the crate. They carefully pick the lock, then use *mage hand* to open the lid. Inside, packed in straw to protect it, they find a lacquered mahogany box with a gold lock. A quick *detect magic* reveals nothing.

"So it's either nonmagical, which I doubt, or there's a layer of lead inside the box," says Abundance. "Or it's subject to *Nystul's magic aura*."

Abundance inspects the box more closely, and thinks he can see the runes of a *glyph of warding* where the lid meets the box. They decide to place the box back in the crate and deal with it later.

---

An hour later, Magpie spots two bandits hidden in a stand of trees next to the road ahead, obviously waiting for the party. The party approaches them, calling them out for hiding. The bandits, believing themselves to still have the upper hand, burst out from behind the trees. One casts *sleep* on the party. None of them are affected. The other casts *fog cloud* around the party and shouts "Jasper! We need backup!"

From somewhere outside the cloud, they hear more movement. Everyone rushes outside the radius of the fog, and see two more bandits descending from a nearby *rope trick*. However, with their ambush ruined, the bandits quickly realize they're outclassed and surrender.

"Please, have mercy!" exclaims their leader, Jasper.

"Explain yourselves," says Aurelia.

"We're just some students from Crystalport Academy!" says another. "We--- we just do some odd jobs on the side, we were supposed to steal a shipment---"

"You *killed* two people, and injured two more." Aurelia scowls.

"It was the elemental! We didn't realize how powerful it would be!"

"That was very reckless of you," says Abundance.

"We know!" sobs the student.

"Who gave you the job?" asks Valya.

"It was--- there's a tavern in Hart's Crossing, a dwarf there, he sometimes offers us jobs, good pay--- we don't know his name---"

"Oh, don't *lie*," says Aurelia.

"We swear! We don't know it! He, uh, he's always wearing really fancy clothes, lots of gold rings. We were supposed to meet him again a week from now [???] to collect our reward. Same tavern--- uh, the Prancing Stag [???]."

The party confers, and decides to spare them. "Never do something like this again," says Valya. For good measure, they take what gold the students have on them, though it only amounts to 14 gp and 8 sp. "Really?" asks Valya.

"Students," says Qhask, shaking his head.

Suitably chastized, the students collect themselves while the party continues on the road to Crystalport.

---

They reach Crystalport's western gate. Unlike the previous few times they've entered the city, the guards seem very suspicious. "Do you have anything to declare?" asks the guard, obviously suspicious of their covered *floating disk*.

"It's a delicate matter," says Aurelia. "We found an evil relic, and are transporting it to the temple of Soleil to be cleansed and destroyed."

The guard raises an eyebrow. "May I?" she asks, gesturing to the tarp.

"Of course," says Aurelia.

The guard lifts the tarp, and her face goes pale when she sees the statue and feels the evil aura emanating from it. "Oh, I see. Yes, well--- perhaps this *is* a matter for the temple. You may pass." She motions them through, shaken, forgetting about the crate they have with them. "But... what *is* that?"

"We don't know. We're hoping the high priest can tell us."

---

Once inside the city walls, they head directly for the temple and show the statue to Cedric, briefly explaining where they found it and what it had done to Riley's mind. The high priest is nonplussed.

"My goodness! What a disturbing sculpture..." He peers at it, then recoils with a grimace. "I'm not sure what to make of it. It's clearly evil, but it's not of Neesha... Thank you for bringing this to me. We'll store it in a vault and inspect it more closely."

"Do you know anything about the Red Eagle shipping company?" asks Abundance.

"No, I've never heard of them. Why do you ask?"

"We think they might be up to some shady business."

"There's a trader here who might have more information---she's delivering a shipment of food and supplies from the local markets."

They thank Cedric for the lead, and head to the temple's kitchen. Entering they hear a familiar voice. "You!" exclaims Saphielle.

"Saphielle! And Klabrog," Valya adds, as the half-orc enters the kitchen with several large sacks.

"Glad to see you made it to the city," says Saphielle. "What happened in Kyasha's Vale after I left?"

"Well, we weren't able to defeat the hydra. But we found out the hydra is the reason the sacred pool dried up. We're trying to get the Crystalport guard to help." says Valya.

"Have you heard anything about the Red Eagle shipping company?" asks Abundance.

"Huh? Oh, yes." Saphielle looks around the room, motions the party closer, and whispers, "That's a shell company for the Daykin family."

"What would the Daykins want with---" asks Aurelia, then stops and looks at Saphielle, who looks intrigued.

"Please, go on," Saphielle says with an innocent smile.

"You'll understand if we're reluctant to," says Abundance.

Saphielle sighs. "Yes, yes. Well. If you have any other questions, I'd be happy to trade for information."

They say goodbye to Saphielle and Klabrog, and return to their room at the temple.

---

"We have to open that box," says Abundance, pacing the room. Qhask nods in agreement.

"I agree," says Valya. "What's so illicit that the Daykins are using a shell company to acquire it?"

"I'm not so sure..." says Aurelia.

"Well, we shouldn't give it to Remy," says Abundance. "We need to check for ourselves what it is."

"...Fine," says Aurelia.

They return to the western gate of Crystalport, hiding the lacquered box in their robes. The same guards are still on duty, and let them pass with a nod. They walk along the road for fifteen minutes, until they find a suitably secluded grove.

"I'll pick the lock," says Valya, "but we should open it with *mage hand*."

"We should dig a pit and put the box in it before we open it, in case it explodes," says Abundance.

Valya starts picking the lock, while the rest of the party looks on with worry. Suddenly, a pin ejects from the lock. "Damn it!" shouts Valya, but she's not hurt---she managed to pull her hand away in time. She tries again, and this time there's a click. "It's unlocked."

While Qhask digs the pit, Abundance takes out his alchemist's supplies and analyzes the needle. "It's drow poison," he concludes.

A few minutes later, the pit is deep enough that any explosion the box might produce will be redirected upwards, hopefully keeping the party safe from harm. Standing as far away as possible, Abundance casts *mage hand* and opens the box. There is, indeed, an explosion of fire, but the pit works as intended, and no one is hurt. They cautiously approach the pit and peer down at the box.

Sitting in the box---which they can see is lined with lead foil---is a velvet pillow. Sitting on the pillow is a crystal sphere, about the size of an orange. And inside the crystal sphere, staring back up at the party, is a devil. Her hair is fire, her eyes are jet black pits, and she wears a blood-red gown trimmed with gold. "Finally," she says as she smiles up at the party.

"Who are you?" asks Aurelia, her face grim.

"My name is Valspira," says the devil. "And you are...?"

"We're not telling you our names," says Aurelia.

"How rude," says Valspira. "I'd like to know the names of my rescuers."

"We're not rescuing you," says Valya.

Valspira frowns. "You will, when you hear what I have to offer you."

"I doubt that," says Aurelia.

"If you set me free, I will reward you beyond your wildest imaginations. I know where Tashklon hid the Orb of Souls. I can lead you to the sunken ruins of Ghelroth'Far and its innumerable treasures. I could teach you how to bend the mightiest of kings to your will, if only you release me from my prison. And all you have to do is break this sphere."

"I've never heard of any of those things," says Abundance.

"What? Surely you've heard of..." she trails off. "What year is it?"

"652 AU," says Valya.

"AU? That means nothing to me. Who is king right now?"

"Oriel IX Fentris."

"Fentris?" Valspira barks a laugh. "Then that old bastard Raymond managed to keep his kingdom... Oriel is his daughter, I take it?" The party looks at each other awkwardly. Valspira's face darkens. "Granddaughter?"

"Raymond Fentris was king over 650 years ago," says Valya.

"*What?!*" Valspira's countenance darkens. "You *will* free me *right this instant*! You have no idea how many irons I had in the fire---"

"We will do no such thing," says Aurelia.

The devil puts on a pained smile. "Once more, I can give you unimaginable riches, and all you have to do is---"

"Nope!" says Aurelia.

"I have a question," interrupts Abundance. "Who trapped you in there?"

"The wizard Azakon," spits Valspira. "His soul will be mine yet."

"Well, it's been 650 years---he's probably already dead."

"Hah! I wouldn't count on that. The bastard cheated me---I have no doubt he could cheat death itself."

"Well, I've heard enough," says Aurelia.

Abundance shrugs and starts casting *mage hand*. "No!" shouts Valspira. "You have no idea what you---" The box clicks closed.

"There's no way we can let anyone have her until we know more," says Abundance. Everyone agrees. They return to the city.

---

"What do we do now?" asks Aurelia. "The temples are sending an expedition to Vargrath Keep sometime soon, the gala is tonight, and tomorrow we leave for Kyasha's Vale..."

"Well, we're going to a gala, and we don't have the proper attire," says Vala. "There's only one possibility---I'm shopping for clothes."

While the rest of the party spend some downtime studying and preparing for a possible attack, Valya heads to the clothing district of the city. She returns a while later with two formal gowns---one for herself, and one for Aurelia. She also gives Aurelia a silver pin for her hair.

"That's... very kind of you," says Aurelia in thanks.

Thus prepared, the party heads to the Daykin Estate.

---

There's a line of well-dressed nobles at the entrance to the estate. A servant checks their names one by one, granting them passage. "Ah, yes, guests of Captain Woodmore," he says. "Welcome to the Daykin estate."

The interior of the estate is lavish, unlike anything any of them---except Valya---have ever seen.
