### The Players

- **Aurelia Goldensong**, a high elf cleric of Soleil, Goddess of Light and Passion. She is on her way to the main temple of Soleil in The Shining Citadel, capital of Castalia.
- **Vahadryl "Valya" Haedel**, a dark elf fighter, obviously not from Castalia. She doesn't talk much about where she's going or where she came from.
- **Fergus O'Toole**, a human bard who has been in Kyasha's Vale for a few days, getting to know the local loggers and listening to their tales of shadows seen in the woods of late.
- **Qhask Bronzeback**, a kobold ranger. His master, the bronze dragon Caranthiax, was recently murdered by demons. He doesn't know if any other kobolds survived the assault on the dragon's lair.
- **Abundance**, a human wizard who joined the party during their escape from Vargrath Keep. He comes from Khorsir, a country to the north where magic is practiced more openly.
